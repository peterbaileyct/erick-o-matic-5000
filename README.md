## How to use
Thus far, there is no UI. You need to open this repo up in a tool like VS Code, paste the data into the JSON file, and run the python script.

## Data extraction
The automated data extraction is a work in progress. For now, it has to be pasted manually into JSON format and then the script can be run.
